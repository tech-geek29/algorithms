# All Indices of Number

Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find all the indexes where x is present in the input array. Save all the indexes in an array (in increasing order).
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

## Input format
```aidl
Line 1 : An Integer N i.e. size of array
Line 2 : N integers which are elements of the array, separated by spaces
Line 3 : Integer x
```

## Output format
```aidl
indexes where x is present in the array (separated by space)
```

## Constraints
```aidl
1 <= N <= 10^3
```
